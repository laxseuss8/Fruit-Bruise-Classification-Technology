# Fruit-Bruise-Classification-Technology
A bruise detection and classification system for bell peppers using multiple low-cost cameras integrated with machine learning to assess bruise severity. This innovative approach aims to reduce food loss caused by rapid ripening and spoilage due to bruising. 

The files were separated in training the models, a GUI for user interface, installed packages in the Raspberry Pi, and the final working code of the device.

The machine learning models was built using Google Colaboratory. Various ML models were trained and the top 3 models that has the highest accuracy were picked and optimized using GridSearchCV.

The project was implemented in Raspberry Pi 4B, the sensors used are 3 Raspberry Pi NoIR Camera with a light support of 940 nm IR led for the NoIR camera to see in the enclosed dark chamber.

See the "diagram" file for further understanding of the project.
